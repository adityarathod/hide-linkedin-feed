# Hide LinkedIn Feed

The LinkedIn feed is a source of anxiety for many young job-seekers.

This Chrome extension aims to fix that problem by hiding the LinkedIn feed button and redirecting all requests to the feed to the Jobs page.

(This was made in about half an hour, so there most definitely will be bugs)
